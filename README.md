This is the official documentation for Coinable, a token payment platform built on Solana and powered by a first class community.

The documentation contains information on `products` offered by Coinable and step-by-step tutorials for the common user.

The `developers` sections provides resources for developers looking to integrate a payment layer using Coinable's API and build next-gen Web3 applications.

We welcome your comments and pull requests to improve the documentation.
