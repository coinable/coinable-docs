# Introduction

**Coinable** is a non-custodial Web3 eCommerce and payments platform powered by the Solana blockchain. We are focused on delivering the powers of Web3 eCommerce to everyone. All a person needs is a web connection, wallet, and Coinable's suite of Web3 tools to deliver next-generation digital eCommerce experiences from the palm of their hands.

Coinable offers the ability to integrate a customizable pre-built Checkout into an existing website, or launch a no-code online Web3 Store to accept solana payments for goods and services with a few clicks.

Coinable provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be used to build decentralized Web3 payment experiences, which is easy to follow and integrate.

Merchants, creators, artists, and innovators can now **transform businesses to be Web3 compatible and competitive** in the coming digital commerce revolution.

This documentation is for anyone interested in accepting native SOL or tokens such as USDC, USDT, DUST, and any other tokens in the Solana ecosystem.
