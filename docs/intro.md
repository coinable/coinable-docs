# Introduction

**Coinable** is a non-custodial payments platform powered by the [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/). We are focused on the merchant experience and increasing accessibility and borderless P2P commerce opportunities for everyone. All a person needs is a web connection, wallet, and Coinable's Web3 merchant toolbox to deliver next-gen digital commerce experiences from the palm of their hands.

Coinable provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be used to build decentralized Web3 payment experiences, which is easy to follow and integrate. Merchants can now **transform businesses to be Web3 compatible and competitive** in the coming digital commerce revolution.

This documentation is for anyone interested in accepting native SOL or tokens such as USDC, wSOL, and any other tokens in the [Solana ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/solana-ecosystem/).
