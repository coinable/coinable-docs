# Products

## Create products

Products allow users to create products to use with invoices, checkouts, and store-fronts. When creating a new product, a user will be able to specify details, inventory, as well as gate the product by different NFT collections.

## Gate products by NFT collections

Merchants will be able to gate products by NFT collections by simply selecting the collections at product creation time. Coinable automatically checks for the NFTs in the consumers wallet as a proof of membership and handles onchain verification on behalf of the merchant.

:::note

As of 7/26/2022, merchants can select up to two collections, where the consumer will be required to hold proof of membership for both collections in order to successfully complete a payment.
