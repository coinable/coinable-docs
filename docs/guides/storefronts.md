# Storefronts

Creators and merchants can display their services, digital, and physical products at a pre-built hosted storefront, allowing customers to browse products and services offered and pay with SOL, USDC, and other solana tokens through a familiar mobile friendly checkout experience.

Storefronts are fully customizable so that the payment experience by the customer stays consistent with the user's brand.

Don't let inconsistent branding or an unfriendly mobile experience negatively impact the sales conversion rate.

:::note

At the moment, only products priced in `USD`, i.e. where `Pricing currency/token` in the product create/edit field is set to `USD` will be displayed in the pre-built hosted storefront. More options available in 3Q/2022.
