# Storefronts

Creators and merchants can display their services, digital, and physical products at a personal hosted **customizeable** storefront, allowing customers to browse products and services offered and pay with SOL, USDC, and other solana tokens through a familiar mobile friendly checkout experience.

Storefronts are fully customizeable so that the payment experience by the customer stays consistent with the user's brand.

Don't let inconsistent branding or an unfriendly mobile experience negatively impact the sales conversion rate.

# Store Preferences

Through store preferences, users can specifiy the store name, description, socials, and also upload a banner to use with the storefront.
